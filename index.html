    <p>This is the start of a thing. I am not sure exactly what kind of a thing. It is related to <a href="https://youtu.be/cD9utLH3QOk?t=1m59s">talk</a> given by <a href="https://github.com/jdalton">John-David Dalton</a>, where he mentions getting things rolling with just a bit every day. This is where it starts. With an ugly page made up in the middle of the night.</p>
    <p>My current workload is fairly Javascript-heavy, so expect to see more of that. Before, I spent a chunk of time with Java. I don't know that I'll return to it, as I can't think of a particular thing I need which it provides. Ruby is on my radar, too, as I spent time working with PHP. Mostly, this will be a duplicate log of my commits. As the video points out, projects going away makes your pretty graph go away and kind of breaks the gamification.</p>
